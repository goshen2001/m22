   It can get messy
   @Korczi Yeah i always find ways to keep my self enjoyable But sometimes at College I just stick my music on and just focus away Or just do something at Home
   @Korczi Best way to do it mate, just take your mind off things.

   at least with a floater, you can guess how long it's been there. if it looks soupy, that's been at least 2 days lol
   It is very rare, admins don't care about it as long as you don't do it with the intent to ram someone
   Where you going to???
