 Imagine Sparrow Racing with the Scooty get bullied hard 
 I got that Cerberus auto-rifle and that thing is a beast
 GREAT STREAM @Korczi  @korczi I got one, is that what its for?
 Bungie dropping that Ban Hammer on people using aim bots.

 The symbol now shows challenges. Not just powerful rewards
 @korczi no, you buy one or the other, OR both, if you want
 @korczi yes and no dont have as many bounties and what not
 @Korczi when you hit 900 everything opens up for powerfuls

 Tekashi 69 knows both where cotton eye joe came from and where he went

 Hoping for a Black Garden patrol zone like Dreaming City but doubtful 
 what light should I aim for to be ready to try and raid when it drops?
 Is it possible to make older armor sets as powerful as the newer ones?
 My 15 year old is testing my wife and I now so I feel your pain Korczi
 Are Warlocks just a bad PVP class? They feel outclassed by the othe two
 @Korczi Bungie Tweet - just issued a wave of bans for people trying to aimbot
 Make sure you all are on the hot fix patch and not on offline mode chat
 what Happened to mopoint @korczi  How dare he not listen to the drifter
 You don't have to be grinding as hard as Korczi is if you don't want to
 @korczi tweet that @korczi @korczi to see if they can get it worked out
 The worst bit about leveling a character is having to use such crap gun
 FFFUUUUUCCCCCKKKKKK there is so much to do in the game its overwhelming
  thats really disrespectful to dodgers and i think you should apologize
 So the raid comes out tomorrow? @Korczi  But I heard they call you wiener boy
 they should have scattered the armour mods in deterministic old content
 That questliiiine reminded me of Vaughn from bl3 yelling Cardio lyyyyfe
 dont get any better when they hit there 20s my kids are still shits now
 I'd double the fucking grounded period just for the fact she texted it.

 be afraid the shit going down after the raid is going to be mind blowing
 Chat should I make more coffee or Nah? I'm low on grinds and no creamer 
 Cool. Then you're all set @Korczi . Also, the price tag as @Korczi said.
 Weird beer flavor: Mich ultra lime + cactus. Actually insanely delicious
 We need trump to drain the swamp first so korczi can get a clean offkcet

 somebody i know got randys throwing knife already and says its not great
 @korczi especially if you're son is at home crying on the bathroom floor
 does Shadowkeep also give me Forsaken? I am really far behind in D2.....
 chat you cute af see you all tomorrow same korczi time same korczi place
 Korczi I love you   I just don't wanna be hateful anymore, no time for it
 it's a very cool mission, just not sure why it rewards the riskrunner LUL
 to the point where you're not sure if you're reading an article or an add
 @korczi i would hope so but bungie is never good with finishing story tbh
 just got kicked out of a mission and now have to do it all over again wtf
 are traction boots elemental gear locked? still new to the armour system.
 We all remember when Sleeper dominated Gambit. Those were some dark times
 do you know how to get the shotgun essence or is it just random to get it
 @korczi hop on and find out cause any answer you get from chat is suspect
 @Korczi May it be that some people are playing with the patch and some without?
 Imagine thinking multiple issues are important at once, that's unheard of
 Going for WF or Week 1 raid completion with the boys? @korczi  @korczi no
 I like the idea of lost sectors not just being a race to a miniboss nuke.
 @Korczi no streaming necessary to go for world first. it's recorded bungie side
 @korczi @Korczi Ok, thanks. I'll take a look at the damage numbers later.
 new drinking game. every time korczi dies during the raid you take a shot
 @Korczi Why did Cube World flop so hard? Haven't been around since last Friday.

 want to know why vanguard strike playlist keeps dropping into exodus crash
 If you haven't played D2 since Forsaken have fun. there is a lot to do now
 @korczi do you know about the 970 nightmare under the entrance to the keep
 Sam usually seems pretty understanding of big weeks like this though right?
 I should be grinding that light but instead I'm watching you, Got. Damn you
 We listen to you talk because you're the songbird of our generation Korczi.
 Man I'm gonna stop sending you emails if you keep sending me auto responses
 what the heck gun is that? oh man my AR doesn't chew through guys like that
 I really feel like Truth tracking takes longer to acquire than in did in D1
 I recommend getting the second grenade for arc, it makes it go much quicker
 Does not having forsaken and shadowkeep hinder your progress to 960 at all?
 th acolyte isn't in the hellmouth, mine was in anchors of light yesterday ?
 @korczi Just looking for one, so when he comes out, he knows who the dad is

 What's the concensus of best leveling methods after all Milestones are done?
 What's the concensus of best leveling methods after all Milestones are done?
 speaking of Forbes - Tassi crying about finisher mods consuming super energy
 why Destiny mobs are too bad at shooting on the mark.this ruins enjoyability

 Raid is called Garden of Salvation, darkness said they are our Salvation....
 Does anyone know if its mandatory to stream while doing the WF raid attempt?
 @korczi aim a sniper rifle and spin 360 and you'll see all chest in the area
 My 4 year old tells me all the time she hates me when she cant have anything
 I'm having ton of fun right now with a random scout rifle that has dragonfly
 I just switch to pc, will playing with a controller put me at a disadvantage?
 love you korczi and chat gonna play some minecraft^^..korczi got me into it^^
 Chat, is got doing gambit for bounties/powerfuls? Or is there another reason?
 I thought you dont lose attunement until you get all nine primes for the week
 @korczi either is fine but battle pass come with the deluxe which helps a lot
 Korczi i need a new office chair but i dont want some bullshit "Gaming Chair"
 @korczi Thanks for the fun. Not sure if it helped me switching to arc though.
 @Korczi Haha I Love it. Watch out for sticker shock though. It can get kinda pricey
 I saved up enough EZ coins for an emote  only got it for 24 hours though.....
 Does this ogres keeps respawning or is this a quest sorry i havent played yet
 guys, how is he getting so much light? just prime engrams and power quests???
 @Korczi after the raid on saturday. then he will rotate bl2 d2 and cube world
 is destiny loot based mainly on quest rewards, or does mob loot play into it?
 @korczi Wont put you at a disadvantage if thats your comfortable control style
 It's like... when everything is an ad, nothing is an ad, you know what I mean?
 @Korczi Sounds like the lead singer, but yeah not quite their style. Who is it then?
 A lot of people don't know this but @Korczi streams from a fanboat on the everglades
 that wasnt me, it was my team and i agree with the things u said about my team
 Can't watch raid streams because OU should be kicking Kansas rear at that time
 just failed a bergusia forge for the first time in 3 months. new light indeed 
 man that assault rifle that fires 2+ bullets thats like 1k dmg x2 , is so good
 thats why im an asshole online no one will suspect me of being a murderer then
 oh is there any easy way to get tribute hall stuff without the spider unlocked?
 so flkr crit build even without the Infinite ammo is better than the rakk build
 'streamer named korczi bullying new light players 2 days after expansion drops'
 sittin at a mexican restaraunt with a tamale plate on the way. gonna be so good
 man i wish i had bought a swordbear/became legend shirt when i had the chance..
 How do you do the weekly memory purist for eirs? Not sure what its referring to
 well if it goes like last election it will be president of the separated states
 still haven't found essence of servitude - maybe it'll be available after raid?
 I got some vex things in the season pass and have no idea what they are for....
 How the hell are you 925 when I keep getting lower than my level powerful drops 
 Korczi, whats your opinion on the time limited titles for season of the undying?
  I haven't tried it personally but tbh if you aren't your ally who can you trust
 Getting back into destiny but hadnt played since Taken King so Im a little lost 
 what is the power level that contest will no longer provide a boost on the raid?
 it would be cool if we could earn ornamenta via quests. i love earning cosmetics
 Don't take it the wrong way but the bar is pretty low so don't rule yourself out
 @Korczi all the titans i see are striker and shotgun sliding with melee finishes 
 Give me something I need then says fuck you this is why your my favorite streamer
 damn, just saw a bungie tweet about them banning a wave of accounts using aimbots
 I cant stand toxic atmospheres. triggers my ptsd hard. I like that its chill here
 @korczi whats your controller sensitivity. an what would think be the best to try
 So how do u level up a alt now that theres no time gate? How would i go about it?
 Do I have to have my most powerful items on all the time to get powerful stuff or
 im not entirely sure how to even farm and grind shit  im very new to Borderlands 
 as a father of 2 girls I am not looking forward to that. I have a few more years.
 the gameplay look was fun and fine but the drop rates on the armor was just stupid
 @korczi knockout(bottom tree striker) counts as an arc ability and you can spam it
 @korczi or when one of your hairs gets stuck on your belt or pants and you stretch
 chat, if you sub with twitch prime, you can guarantee that dodge success rate 100%
 the battle pass is pretty decent too. not usually into battle passes but i like it
 I think the story was there as an intro to the broader story to come over the year
 Wait a sec. I dont think that was his real voice. I think hes making fun of us. :)
 I switched from nights to days. So now my sub goes to @Korczi instead of just following.
 You have the best intentions in mind for her so letting her know that is important
 because the chicken guy is cayde but the ghosts lines are as if you dont know cayde
 korczi have you heard about the 1 2 punch, shoulder charge titan one hitting bosses
 some parenting about to happen. korczi about to go do the stare with dramatic music
 Korczi, the 970 nightmare under the bridge gives a weekly powerful drop, i believe.
 @korczi dont forget to take precautions s so your raid team doesnt get ddosed again
 Way to go my man @korczi  @Korczi Pretty sure its a damage buff against bigger nightmares
 Is it possible to join korczis clan or is there a limited amount of space per clan?
 @Korczi He has also spent countless hours getting the best weapons possible for her.
 what should i look for in armor when deciding whether to keep or dismantle ? im a wl
 no one wants to do gambit @Korczi  I just finished the campaign im on 869 what should i do
 your artifact power bonus will surely be taken into account for the raid cap right ?
 so, i didnt play forsaken and its almost overwelming how much stuff i have to do lol
 Does anyone know what happens after you give all the rice cakes to the Jade Rabbits?
 @korczi I dont think you understand how many Ys there are in the greater TAMPA area.
 @Korczi you prolly will never see this but do you think this expansion is worth getting???
 @Korczi Feel like I'm too far behind to understand the "deeper" parts of the game now
 yeah I've been nice and respectful, some people just get a serious case of the Redass
 @korczi Yeep, they caught a bunch of Aimbot clients running on the new steam platform
 man, so excited to hear the eternal drone of a recluse for yet another goddamn season
 @korczi grant i went for tacos this morning and the lady gave me free pancakes.  nice
 short of tyhreatening civil war over impeachment? not sure how it could get any worse
 What are the most viable raid and pvp classes that people have the most success with?
 matchmaking in nightfalls is the single greatest thing they have added since year one
 is there a quest for that weapon? @korczi  Chat what should i use my ez coins to say?
 Cant wait til they get rid of one of he gambits so I dont have to do it for a powerful
 i left stream with this song on a few hours ago. came back with the same song running 
 I've mostly solo grinded to Reckoner..........you have no idea how bad it is in Gambit
 yeah, @korczi has had too much internet today. He can be grounded from this community.
 It's like that very famous clip of when Broman got his Gljally but the opposit of that
 @Korczi i think its bugged or its supposed to be dmg buff for nightmare bosses, not sure tho
 Is it just me or does the stream stutter a whole lot when the sub bomb animation plays
 just watched the stream in 720p not 60 it looked horrible, 1080p60 truly is a blessing
 Are we getting ez coins reset this month or we gonna continue with the same ? @korczi 
 @korczi completely false. i bought the deluxe edition on pc and I have the season pass
 Yeah @Korczi you need to infude your prime gear. Light Level is factored with other guardians
 Youre the only streamer I know uses a controller on pc for this game and STILL kick ass
 From what I am seeing is it hurt me but not anyone else with me, so shotgun are a no no
 @korczi Crit FL4K is still his strongest build it's just not every gun is Lucian's Call
 We had a glitch in this lost sector where the boss didnt spawn and we had to start over
 Is the last raid encounter supposed to be 920??? Thats what Im hearing from everyone....
 I'm certain the story is going to continue once the raid is either started, or completed
 @Korczi I believe its an event that starts on Saturday but honestly dont konw what it is
 hey @Korczi what is a good way to even out my gear? i have 3 peices at 916 rest are at 910-913
 Are gambit rank ups dropping near or above your current level? Sorry, been busy at work.
 Still cant figure out why my new cyber power shuts off a few minutes into playing D2    
 I think they found a really nice balance between grinders and causal for the power grind
 This is why it's so important to punish with love in mind and really get the love across
 Is DIM down @Korczi  im so confused, i was timed out for an hour for some reason and now im not
 hey if i bought Destiny 2: Forsaken Complete Collection would i have shadowkeep for free?
 @korczi I tried to get the coffee in San Luis Obispo Cali hope goods and they told me no 
 is raiding available in matchmaking? or do you have to rustle up a group and form a clan?
 So im new to D2 do all exotics drop at max gear score @Korczi  Mr Vain lol childhood flashbacks
 I don't know about running for president when you clearly support the idea of a monarchy.
 Chat, you have to choose one: brussel sprouts, beets, or artichokes. Which do you choose?
 Need to give them space to make mistakes but bring the hammer when shit like this happens
 My kids never want to go outside and play like we used to do as kids. Not worth the fight
 imagine being so entitled that you think other people dont have a right to talk to you LUL
 @korczi Thanks, i need some dad clothing for the newly born. Gotta look the part, ya know?
 @Korczi whats even craizer is the algorithm picked him for a gifted sub with such a short follow
 I really miss the visuals of the hive. TTK was my fav DLC of all time and this looks great
 Oh that one guy left who I told to fuck off LUL, Hope he at least that he won that Argument
 @korczi No, Crit Build is still the best way to play FL4K but its not infinite ammo anymore
 i'm installing D2 now, watching you the past couple of days put me right in the mood for it
 is there any reason to keep old weapons and gear 1.0? like better devils or leviathan gear?
 anyone know if the Eriana's Vow package from the season pass has powerful armour past 900+?
 @korczi its a very specific type of game that it appeals to. for me, looked boring as hell.
 @Korczi might not have seen my highlighted message what are your top 2 perks to get on a primary?
 I still know every word to this song but I can't remember my breakfast order from yesterday.
 it seems to suffer from the same thing that makes people hate . "Heavy ruins the game mode".
 @Korczi You should be able to try it again now, there was a cooldown from when i typed it in
 I cant even hear this song without thinking about the Simpsons We work hard and we PLAY HARD
 Does DIM still work for Steam PC? Just switched from PS to PC.. Don't know where to begin xD
 what power was menage @korczi  What chair do you have? Mine is worn and in need of a new one
 @korczi tht guy apologized so please u ban him if you can we love each other no time to hate
 @Korczi i mean sometimes my cat likes to take an unannounced stroll across it and then bite me LUL
 caner6545 a lot of exotics got a catalyst, including Cerberus, which is an underrated exotic
 I finally got my Ikelos shotgun during Mars week, even though it isn't a meta weapon anymore
 Hey chat, is traction just a random mod drop now? Cant seem to slot it anywhere on my boots.
 has anyone gotten a rice cake before completing the lost sector where we see the first bunny
 So chat how about them Sports ugh? Cowboys doing good I hear  balls being thrown and what not
 He was just trying to sell you some vending machine spaghetti. You shocked him with violence.
 I heard "chat" is a racist term from 1492 so we can't say that anymore. Enjoy reddit, jackass
 @Korczi Why no more Flashpoint, weekly rewards? My map is empty...... So we have to get Shadowkeep?
 does prime attunement reset daily? because after the downtime i suddenly have mine back again
 @korczi a Trophy Belt? Plus for a content creator it can bring them traffic/follows/subs, etc
 I had to block that guy in whispers last week actually too @Korczi  @korczi 1 off it is it 900 then
 anybody mention you can use crucible and iron banner ornaments from collections on your gear?
 High Cunductor.... Is this just like a dude who drives a train that's just straight stoned???
 What was your feeling whenever you announced GCX and everyone clapped for at least 5 minutes?
 does anyone know how to run the New Light mission on an existing char? I haven't seen it yet.
 Reddit post about Minotaur being spotted in the summoning pits. Starting a little early maybe?
 Have they fixed the match making for Strikes and such yet? I kept being put in solo last night
 korczi am doing the vow catalyst i did the moon strike towards it but i still have 0% on erned
 @korczi Korczi doesnt work for Bungie, take your whiny, negative bullshit complaint elsewhere.
 Chat I want you guys to know that you're cute and I love you guys     Best folks on twitch here
 @Korczi He was hoping the steam group would work but it doesnt. So that command will get you in
 @Korczi Do you ever dig and make sandcastles on the beach by yourself sometimes with your red bucket?
 @Korczi if you bought the 35 you have this season if you bought the 60 you have this and 3 more
 crucible and iron banner ornaments work on your gear if you pull the ornaments from collections
 @Korczi 10-15 hr days, stacking 3 characters, doing powerfuls and then using legendaries to gap fill.
 I'm confused. I didn't take that as a bad question. Like who likes to drink beer....or something
 Soft cap is 900, powerful cap is 950, prestige cap is 960, and then you can go infinitely higher
 @Korczi That is a way to look at it, but not completely correct. It has its benefits and merits.
 @korczi destiny 2 new content came out yesterday & there's a raid to prep for coming on saturday
 @korczi Because in hard content like raids their sheer numbers and blanket approach do the damage
 how do we get everything appearing on the destination screen mines blank except the moon and city
 when are we gonna get another fallen raid, i love the depth of the hive stuff but we need a break
 does any one know if the exotic engrams on the season pass track is account wide or per character
 People complained about D1 not being in D2, then complain about recycled content when SK released
 @korczi Find bosses you can kill efficiently, beat them, save quit, repeat. Or do slaughter shaft
 is she the second child. me and my family have a theory about second children. they're the devil.
 is there any easy way other than spider to get tribute hall relics other than spider and bounties?
 There is a timer on the lost sector loot? You have wait a while before opening the chest again no?
 I ate five guys (no homo) today and it was fucking delicious. @korczi  gambit prime is just awful.
 @korczi did you notice you can now switch exotic catalyst kills between crucible and vanguard now?
 @korczi Im not sure about the past 900 but I dont think you have to have them from my understanding
 I apologize in advance but have yall already looked at the Raid teaser@korczi  Turds gonna be turds
 Kiffar Catalyst isn't so good in , too many one shots at that range, but holy hell is it strong in 
 looking foward to watching you race i always try to get as cozy as i can for wf races good luck bud
 @Korczi thanks, but is there any easy way to get tribute hall items other than the free daily quests
 as someone who works in advertising, thanks for supporting the industry @Korczi  forbes levels is too much
 you know you've been lurking awhile 2hen you hear songs twice LUL @korczi  you need more for gambit?
 @Korczi side note that riskrunner mission if you dont have the catalyst it gives you it at the end as well
 I'm not even gonna use your real name. I'm literally writing in "king korczi" for president LUL
 i had to solo it first time through because matchmaking was fucked but still had no problems with it
 is there a clip of when korczi told everyone datto found hawkmoon when he raided him the other day ?
 havent played since they release D2 and messed it up. did they bring back OG trials and mechanics???
 @Korczi what safeguards will you use for their pc? i'm in the same boat as you with my preteen daughter...
 truth is the only thing that got me through the gambit games for solstice. even had fun once or twice
 TFW you scratch your nuts and accidentally locks one up but you dont notice untili you feel the pain 
 Wait do I have to install D2 again on Steam, or wont steam recognze it if I had it through Battle net
 I wonder how many guys are gonna watch you do the raid with their girlfriends boyfriends on saturday 
 this is my 1st time grinding multiple toons... and holy hell does the 2nd toon go faster than the 1st
 @Korczi What do you think of the Chattering Bone? Just got it a couple days ago and haven't broken it in yet
 The amount of ogers died today is ridiculous lol in remaining ogres dream korczi gonna show up tonight
 so i can just go back to the boss areas and fight them over again? @Korczi  The outside of it at least
 That conductor should be FIRED. How dare that conductor show up to work high. What a high conductor SMH
 why dont you go to the area on the moon that spawns an ogre and 3 elites got mine done in 10 mins there
 what should i start with after i hit 900 light? @korczi  you have alot of short range stuff for this map
 This is the busiest fall youve probably ever had @korczi  i only got glimmer from all lost sectors i did
 @Korczi If i havent played since b4 forsaken can i dismantle all my old epics after i replace them from year 1
 So korczi as for prep, we should be doing Tier 1 powerful drop activities before moving on to T2 and T3?
 It's so cool being back on the moon. I enjoyed the scenery and how it has changed since we last visited.
 i feel like the contest power limit is too low. have a feeling worlds first isnt gonna take that long :/
 moon lost sectors combine with heroic public event was the best for this part of the quest in my opinion
 does it calculate your item level drop from all characters and vault or only current character and vault?
 Honestly, you know how much shit Korczi would get because he uses the word c*nt if he ran for office lol.
 KING KORCZI 2020: He isn't THAT bad. I mean... I think he's funny as fuck. and I like Wings and beer
 Wait, why did she steal ? Just cause she wanted one? Or some real specific reason? Missed the start of it
 there's always that last little guy tryna fight. It's like didnt you see I just murdered your entire squad
 They buffed Rakk Attack. Gonna check that out since Fl4k's crit build isn't as viable as OP as it once was
 Man, remember back when we were robbing crotas grave to help us to kill his dad, good times good times LUL
 Any decent financing firm will tell you to always deposit your motes. US Bank just sent out a PSA yesterday
 What's your opinion on the Deathbringer? @korczi  This coffee is so smooth I want to try it without creamer
 Ah alright. So is there a boss or an area or something that youd recommend me going to? @Korczi  @Korczi TY
 Mmmm id probably check yourself korczi. Were chat.... we say a lot of things that could or could not be true
 @korczi they said theres multiple versions that are fun a cycle. Maybe its just this version thats like that
 Been a while just considering getting back into things with update, what has everyones thoughts been so far?
 When you get excited to watch Lupo on the other monitor but he's hosting some dude with exceptional hair....
 When you just realize that korczi his his first daugher when he was 21.... He just learned to adult a little
 Id say the power gain is dumb now for some reason I keep getting lower level than what Im using for powerfuls
 on a borderlands related note.. does this recent patch today make the rakk build the play over the crit build?
 Any critiques on Shadowkeep? Some of my friends say they feel underwhelmed @korczi  @korczi what happened dude
 which are you enjoying more this or borderlands @Korczi Just curious on your perspective of the two looter shooters.
 I heard Sony is now open to crossplay for all games  cross save is a brilliant addition for D2 too. Good stuff
 so basically i can just farm 1 boss and it can give me all sort of shit? @Korczi am i understanding it right? 
 @korczi Human Design  not every exotic in destiny deserved to be as OP as Gjallarhorn, the game wouldn't be fun
 Interesting, my phones screen keeps flashing for some reason, Doesn't happen in any other app but Twitch  weird
 Chat once i hit 900 do i start doing powerful engrams or is there certain steps i need to do first to maximize?
 @korczi They are two very different games. Wouldn't compare them at all as far as core gameplay experience goes
 Picture this: We just hit 900 power. What are we doing for the power grind? @korczi  is the menagerie solo now?
 got the new moon auto with outlaw rampage and my giddy aunt does it shred. definitely be my first new masterwork
 If I send my alt armor it can't wear, does that count when it comes to power level drops? or is it just weapons?
 I was exactly like that too. Just know that they don't mean it and will appreciate everything you do in 10 years
 @korczi its not one of the free one, no. not sure if you can access him withiut it, since you meet him in a quest
 @Korczi it makes the loot economy much more enjoyable when you arent getting garbage drops from every little thing imo.
 speaking of powerfuls, i hate that crucible has 2 powerfuls tied to it now and that i have to play 8 total games 
 Remember when Bungie announced this game mode and said it would be revolutionary???? What happened to that chat??
 Korczi is there a reason you don't use that one destiny twitch addon? Just curious cause I see others using it :)
 Nice playin with you. Good to see you around. Weve interacted a few times on twitter. Good luck with worlds first
 omg man, when I load into solo queue comp all I run into is sweat lords who play so well together. so frustrating
 despite the campaign being pretty short i think bungie made some incredible changes and additions. d2 feels goood
 What time are you thinking of ending the stream today? I have a test soon and am gonna need the stream after lmao
 @Korczi yes amara need "a good setup", but she also has twice the usefull anointement compared to other characters
 i think people forget that they have to subtract the artifact bonus to calculate what thier powerful drops will be
 Can you send your guardians from different platforms to have 3 of each per platform without having to delete them?
 Just did a 2v3 freelance survival and just dunked on the enemy team with sweet business, its sooo good with war rig
 for discomfort you have to have them point at the faces from 1 to 10 of the amount of discomfort and take a picture
 @korczi Bahroo just posted a video showing that the Moes nerf did absolutely nothing and she can still spam grenades
 Funny thing is were all mostly grown men mad at a little twerp on the internet. Let them rot in their own misery LUL
 if i just hit 900+ is there anything i can do before i start getting the t1 powerful rewards? @Korczi love the content bby
 whats a good hawaiian shirt brand @Korczi  @Korczi Is the Exotic engram on the Seasonal Pass limited to one Character? Or all 3?
 It like a slight chance for it to happen to me. most of the time it doesnt damage me, but every now and then it does
 I haven't played since Curse of Osiris, but just picked up forsaken and shadow. Any must have exotics I need to get?
 yes i did @korczi  @korczi then you've fucked something up with cross play bud. I have it active and I'm fine on PC.
 I think we were all the same as kids. Its just funny how we are on this side of the fence this time and its not cool
 Hey everyone, havent played since forsaken, is it worth getting back in or should I wait for D3 if thats even a thing
 @korczi watching your stream today helped me get in the zone for my interview today. I think it went great. Thank you
 @Korczi I'm digging it, finished the catalyst a little while ago and it is nasty, need to be close but it hits like a truck
 I finally caved and plugged in a controller on PC for  but I have some pretty bad input delay.. any tips to reduce it?
 yeah deathbringer is satisfying to use. if you get all the baby novas to connect shit wrecks. takes getting use to tho
 Chat how do i find out what version of shadowkeep i bought like i want to know if i purchased the future season or nah
 outside of the server hiccups I am having a blast, I am going through the older content first before I go to the moon.
 @Korczi i love everytime you turn theres just a REEEEEEE shooting across the screen at full speed on a mini sparrow. comical
 Thats one thing I regret the most. Is every time I ever told my parents I hated them. When we are kids we are dumb lol
 you mean you don't like doing gambit again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again
 This place reminds me of the Taken King. I got my PS4 with the Taken King art work on it. I bought it just for Destiny.
 @korczi i would actually say get Forsaken, the content was amazing and its only $25 for the DLC and annual pass content
 @Korczi how do perks for armor 2.0 work? i haven't been able to play much so i haven't been able to actually try it out myself
 What do you have your video settings at? Just full ultra? or have to played with it here and there for best performance?
 @Korczi they'd brought it back as an exotic in Year 3 Destiny, and it's back again as a white weapon for New Light users
 @korczi do we think bungie will nerf the 1 2 punch, shoulder charge titan before raid, its literally 1 hitting everything
 korczi i think there are more important isssues than whether a perk hurts you or not like the game overheating Xbox one X
 Why are you asking me if I dont have it unlocked yet Kappa @korczi  Don't use a potato then you won't have FPS issues... 
 i retired from my pro dodging days once i got hit i just got too old  @Korczi  @korczi Now i just gotta get the voice down lmao
 My kids can say anything they need to, to get something off their chest but can't say that to my wife. That's a big no no
 I was a shit because my parents wouldn't let me do anything so I was always trying to push the envelope of what I could do
 She texted Sam that she hates you... Yep normal pre-teen into Teen stuff Korczi  you got this, I know you're a good parent
 @korczi but it's his job, he's the character with the lowest amount of survivability, if eh can't kill things fast he's dead
 @korczi yeah... the reports are so wildly inconsistent... I'd say we all check tomorrow when everyone has the patch for sure
 I'm new to destiny and I was wondering what's the best way to level up past 900 once you've completed all the weekly rewards
 I'm sad it's Saturday. I've been watching you raid since Kingsfall... now I'm busy Saturday. I'm going to miss it. Sad face.
 btw chat, in borderlands 3, what happens when you finish the story in TVHM?  im not really sure what to do once that happens
 @korczi all armor sets from year 1 and 2 now have armor 2.0 versions you can earn so you can make them completely customized
 Im fucked.... Im out of powerful drops at level 913 and I only have one character and I really wanted to try the new raid....
 Is that the daughter the other day who brought you BBQ sauce for your tenders and Napkins? Swear she sounded EXACTLY like Sam
 My wife and I had this song on one time and were facing each other. When we both dipped our knees hit and it was very painful.
  reduces range drastically for a much tighter spread and increased damage. Hits like a truck in , no need for shotguns anymore
 what's your season pass rank @korczi  @korczi Ah see ok, the pyramid in this expansion just reminded me a lot of the siva raid
 World drops as in it can drop everywhere? Or is it something that doesnt requrie you to kill a specific enemy? @Korczi  Click 
  yeah, it may be so. I just want Fl4k to be more than a one trick pony. I was hoping his other action skills were more powerful
 i just got the riskrunner and oh boy is that a juicy one. you can even proc the thing with your own arc grenades love that shit
 the risk runner quest is for new light players who didn't get the weapon from ashir @korczi  Theres a ding emote you can buy lol
 I'd like to think it's a little goblin half the size of the chest just pulling it across the land to hide in nooks and crannies.
 Chat, do seasonal ranks unlocked on one character transfer to other characters? Or do I need to unlock seasonal ranks separately?
 I LOVE this mission. Helping Eris Morn cope with her previous trauma's is a thing I didnt even realize I wanted out of this game.
 I've been trying to find the right brew time for my first club membership. These Uganda Kings Coast beans are pretty interesting.
 so now the world knows your daughter is at the Y in Tampa until 630 PM when you will be there lol seems like good info to give out
 @Korczi Did you get the special green glowing ghost and emote? Those came with the same version that came with all 4 season passes.
 @Korczi the sparrow was from an event that isn't around anymore so unless they offer it during the event next year you can't get it
 Chatroom, does anyone know if I'll be able to keep doing my Forsaken quests on a cross save diff console that only owns Shadowkeep?
 @Korczi hey korczi, im trying to buy engarms and they're only vcoming out at 900 light and wont go any higher and im 902 power, any ideas?
 @korczi you dont need forsaken to buy shadowkeep. But if you want forsaken on PC licenses dont transfer so youd have to buy it againh
 hollow point is not hurting me, just installed the patch and stood right in front of enemies and took no damage. tried on 2 characters
 i still haven't gotten my account to transfer keep getting errors... it sucks bungie doesn't have any type of support other then forums
 Hey KG can you show your quests page right now? I want to see what it looks like in late game since mines like 3 pages long as a newbie.
 @korczi no it doesnt. the pyramid ships are the starships for the race most closely sligned to the darkness (the traveler's sworn enemy)
 @Korczi doesn t matter,if mobs of any game are idiot this will ruin any enjoyability pros of that game even if everthing is so good except that
 Korczi, the "come one and slam" saying for your subs... that is a red phrase on some slam relics in BL3. did you give them that idea? lol
 do you think daughters of crota were underwhelming? @Korczi  @Korczi if you look up during the last ride up, theres a "captured travelers" easter egg
 It's true look at the forums, many players including myself paid $60 and still don't have the pass. So far Bungie is being quiet about it.
 @korczi yeah I still had mine in the vault when the exotic came out. just couldn't remember the name. didn't know it was back in D2 though.
 @Korczi so all of the perk options for armor. are those rolled randomly or are those unlocked somehow? i don't understand how armor 2.0 works yet/
 @Korczi There is a saying that i love. "what did you gain, you cheated yourself out of growth and it's sad you don't know that you are missing out"
 Ive got a 15 year old that started being a turd right around 11-12. Shes mellowed our now but you got a good 2-5 years left. Stay the course.
 I know raid weeks are increased revenue weeks, but if you could put a percentage on it, says like 10%-20% extra of your normal monthly income?
 @korczi oof idk about that one, i'd go get shadowkeep first cuz new contenr and if you miss all the old content of forsaken i'd get that later
 this stream makes me feel like i'm 12 playing games in my room and my sister is bumping boy band (all of them) music down the hall in her room
 @korczi @korczi this dude wispers me saying facking poor non sub dont talk to a dude who is sub  @korczi is the dude like whats wrong with him
 @korczi and you will find a lot of the meta weapons people currently use are from Forsaken content so its best to be at par if you play crucible
 @Korczi Not that it's any of my business but do your kids ever use the excuse "But dad plays games all day" when you get on them about games and stuff?
 @Korczi IF you get the cerberus +1 Catalyst, the new firing mode on it hits like a fucking truck at close range. Holy shit. Major Knight down in 4 shots
 @korczi I used to be a HARDCORE hardcore fan like 6-8 hours a day and I just got burnt out when my friends stopped playing, is it fun mostly solo?
 anyone know why i can't do the final story mission? i have every piece of armor but when i go up to the beacon for the mission i can't do anything
 Its dangerous to go alone, take this  @korczi  its cuz there's like 3 or 4 different versions of elimination and they're testing them one at a time
 @korczi Imo so far the story was so short that if you have no one to play with, Id wait a little until they add more to the story line after the raid
 @korczi whats your opinion on the nerfs to characters in borderlands? Cause its pve do you think they should nerf characters or let us be op like bl2?
 @korczi whats your opinion on the nerfs to characters in borderlands? Cause its pve do you think they should nerf characters or let us be op like bl2?

 @korczi whats your opinion on the nerfs to characters in borderlands? Cause its pve do you think they should nerf characters or let us be op like bl2?
 Drifter needs a new voice line- "You ever run into that witch named Eris, you kick her right in the teeth and say Drifter sends his regards, you hear?"
 Korczi have you got the Cerberus catalyst? It makes it into a kind of full auto shotty that makes it do crazy damage up close @korczi  @korczi one of us 
 I haven't played Borderlands 3 yet but I'm guessing it might still be doing self damage. Not sure but I'm thinking there's a possibility, hope that helps
 korczi can you give my mom a shoutout, im at the tire shop waitin on an alignment but ieft your stream on the tv. would be hilarious if she hears you lol
 @Korczi characters are still overall powerful like bl2. gbx is trying to avoid levels of broken where one character is an obvious choice for any activity
 @Korczi @Korczi I have 3 vault hunters level 50 other than Zane and Fl4k is by far the easiest choice for boss melting. it needed to be addressed and it was.
 Its upto you korczi but i would like to forgive him n give him a virtual hug n if you want to you can unban him. I dont like someone getting banned cos of me
 Hey Korczi, so I was thinking.. have you ever thought about dabbling in certain.. plant like financial endeavors? Kings Kush would be a great sell I'd imagine
 @korczi Apparently your weapons level is what determines DPS. Not your overall power.  tester it and tweeted. I always though overall power was what mattered.
 @korczi yes you need to give the rice cake to the bunny. I got one after I went in there but cant get back into it now. did you get it killing enemies on moon
 @Korczi yep, and it's also my job to do "human design" (on other games) and it infuriate me that this anointement repartition and design got pass quality check
 @korczi the solo Q competitive is a great addition never really played comp before last night and in a few hours I went from 0-2100 and got recluse it was great
 @Korczi Fun Music fact. They guy who wrote this song Gary Glitter is in jail for 16 years after he was convicted of sexually abusing 3 young girls. Another song Ruined
 @Korczi like, how can i play gamma ray wyhen the whole point of the skill is to keep it up 95% of the time but every single anointed bonus is "after a skill ends"
 a friends daughter said that to her mom, and her dad walked in on it and said, "You may talk that way to you mom, but no one talks that way to my wife and lives."
 people need to make sure they are online and offline too to make sure they have the hotfix @Korczi  @Korczi Probably also important to ask if they're playing online or offline
 where do you find the challenges for bounties? @Korczi  Korczi have you ever held Bass in your hands, maybe a Wub or two, then dropped it? If so, did it break or vibrate?
 @Korczi when you level multiple characters the last you level always gets highest power because you transfer higher power weapons which help them level more quickly
 HEY CHAT a couple questions. first: how do i get a mini sparrow? second: is it still true you dont need your highest light equipt you just need it in your inventory?
 I've always hated our Commander Tangerine, especially after his Cardboard statement but I won't hop on that soapbox today as Twitch is not the place to talk politics
 Hey Korczi, been watching you since 2015 when you played House of Wolves and Taken King. Have been watching you ever since and wanted to say that you're a great streamer 
 if i have a prime engram and its for light level 908. can I sit on it till my light lvl is higher and itll give a higher light lvl? or does it not matter since I can infuse?
 A friend of mine said that every character starts at level 750 now, and there's no longer a reason to do story because it doesn't really get you anything. Is this true, Chat?
 korczi you're the fukin best man love ya. been watching ever since beginning of destiny 1 and playing every since. love just chillin watching new content with you. keep it up
 @korczi Cause that was the game design choice  don't yell at folks in chat over human design  that's like saying all cards in Magic are weak and all cards should be Grave Pact
 I'm a be a hard ass with my daughter and I expect her to tell me she hates me more than a few hundred times, but she will respect me and thank me later. That's how I look at it
 @Korczi This week's Crucible Labs: Elimination has an issue where Heavy Ammo is spawning at the beginning of each round instead of 90 seconds. We've implemented a fix to this issue.
 idk who was sad FL4K got "nerfed" or whatever but i don't feel a change using the build Prof.Broman buld for him, and it destroys on Mayhem 3 with the Flakker shotty and Terminal Crit
 @korczi I mean to be fair all characters have the "After action skill end deal 250% more weapon damage" and the 125% more damage to bosses. Amara is just the fastest cause of Phasecast
 @Korczi hey man. I was watching you a bit this morning (love your stuff btw) but I was wondering about video game jazz music you were playing. Is that a playlist or anything I could look up?
 it is pretty cool that approaching 10k people are generally well behaved together and it makes me happy....thank you for creating the space for us to appreciate a common interest together
 Gambit was also ruled for 1 Year by machine Guns, Sleeper and Queen's Breaker so I mean  it is dominated by Heavy and it doesn't feel good to get mapped by  or Solo supered the moment you invade
 ahh, that explains it then @Korczi , thats the part i wasnt sure of. So is there a way to know what you want, where it drops etc? or is it just go farm random shit and hope something is for you?
 @Korczi What do you think about Bungie scamming thousands of players out of the season pass on the PC using cross-save? Basically if you bought the deluxe version you still don't have the season pass.
 I'd rather just see Korczi clown on them in improv rather than just ban 'em - make 'em leave on their own lol. Or you know, put me in coach Kappa @Korczi  What ended up happening after the  was taken back?
 @korczi Where is crit build is at now is fine now they need to buff his pet build (Gamma burst) and make his Pets actually Do Something along with Iron Bear for Moze, otherwise FL4K is in a good spot
 @Korczi also, the anointed system is completly messed uup and should be redone for 0 : there are too many that profit spammable skill and nothing for skills that you are supposed to keep up for long durations
 @korczi Yes, I am a Amara main, I've killed Graveward in 3 seconds with a Fire Crossroads and a low level fire grenade for a 186% damage increase but that requires a Setup, FL4K could go invis and Delete bosses
 @Korczi so just to be clear, you went to the deathsinger while she was chillin and singing and murdered her. chopped her head off, peeled of the skin, and made a weapon out of it? nice, good we are the good guys here
 @korczi So on PS4 I gameshared forsaken with a friend and did all of the campaign and that. I switched over to pc recently and brought my character over. Do I need to buy forsaken again in order to buy shadowkeep?
 what's up korczi, been watching your streams, great streamer, I am a day one D1 player and played f2 in the beginning, looking to make a return, I have it installed but fucking work lol tomorrow I will finally try it
 you do @Korczi this community is one of my favorites and your mods keep it pretty clean in here. I love that no matter how many viewers are in here im always allowed to chat since im broke and cant sub :) love you korczi and chat
 Ah, yeah I was looking into Gorillaz and found out they're like... on person. With all sorts of collabs, and wouldn't have put this sound past them after listening to some of their ambiguous stuff. Good song tho regardless
 @korczi have u heard u can use a onetwo punch shotgun and use peragrine greave , shoot a shot mid air and shoulder charge straight after and do some stupid amount of damage only possible after this latest patch for some reason
 11 year old might be a little young but there is a series on hulu that is all about people who are kidnapped and murdered through social media and phone apps. I showed that to my 15 year old and now she doesnt even like to get on FB or Insta
 @Korczi they released the game with amara having naturally twice the anointement of ther other characters, it's not "design" it's a big red flag into someone being heavielly influenced to buff one character other the others and should have been adressed before release, riot had an article about how they got huge problems because of that
 @korczi It's a great system it is just RNG tied like every other fucking system in Borderlands. I'm not crying that I don't have X6 Elemental Butcher, I'm not crying that my Moze doesn't have a Mirv HEX so I can be immortal but that is how the game works, RNG and Human design. Now please sir I respect your opinions and I said mine. Now please, go kindly F**k OFF and play more
 @korczi I dunno though cause I think a large sum of the community likes the op builds, that what previous borderlands was about, they never nerfed Sal. But I think the big problem is they are nerfing the viable builds and not buffing the the weak builds, so its kind of bullshit at the moment. They should have waited to do a big patch and do the buffs and nerfs at the same time
